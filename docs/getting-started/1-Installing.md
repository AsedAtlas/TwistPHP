#Installing

Download the TwistPHP framework and extract the folders contents to your `public_html` directory.

Your directory should now look like this:

* public_html
    * twist
        * ...
    * .htaccess
    * index.php

Open your site in a browser and you should be presented with the setup wizard. Follow the steps to set up your framework.
