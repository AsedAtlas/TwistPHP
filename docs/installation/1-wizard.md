#Wizard Installation (Recommended)

Download the latest copy of [TwistPHP](https://github.com/TwistPHP/TwistPHP/releases/latest).

Extract the archive and copy the contents of the `/dist` folder into your website's `public_html` directory.

Your directory should now look like this:

* public_html
    * twist
        * ...
    * .htaccess
    * index.php
    
In your web browser navigate to the root of your website and you will be presented with the Wizard Installer. Follow the onscreen steps to complete the installation process.
