#TwistPHP Coding Conventions

##PHP
All PHP files should use the extension *.php*. Extensions such as *.php4*, *.php5* and *.phps* should be avoided.

PHP files should start with an opening PHP tag with no whitespace before and a blank line after. The closing php tag should always be omitted.
```php
<?php

    //Start code here
```
